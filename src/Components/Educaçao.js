                <h3>UN WOMEN One Win Leads to Another</h3>
                <p>The Programme One Win Leads to Another (OWLA) is a programme implemented by UN Women in partnership with the International Olympic Committee that seeks to use sports as a powerful social transformation tool to reduce harmful gender stereotypes, norms and related behaviours that prevent women and girls to fully enjoy their rights on an equal playing field. The OWLA programme aims at empowering girls through sports so that they can participate, work, govern and enjoy their rights on an equal playing field. Its overall objective is to use sport to change harmful gender stereotypes and norms, so that teenage girls can achieve their rights and fully develop their potential.</p>
